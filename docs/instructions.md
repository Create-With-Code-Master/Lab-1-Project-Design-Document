# Instructions

1. Make a copy of the **[Project Design Document][template] (PDD)**.
1. Watch the **[lesson videos][lesson]** to understand the scope of the project and how to proceed.    
1. After watching the videos, start filling out the PDD.

    Note that each segment of the design document corresponds to a unit. At this point your ideas may be "full of holes" - that's ok. Just do the best that you can and know that as you progress through the course you'll be broadening your sense of possibilities and will be able to refine your PDD.
    
1. Submit a link to the PDD.

<!-- Don't edit links here, change them in _data/assignment.yml instead, -->
