# Instructions

1. Make a copy of the **[Project Design Document][template] (PDD)**, then:
    - Set the Share options to "Anyone at SKSD with link can comment".
    - Rename it, replace "Copy of Lab 1" with your name.
    - In the Author box enter your name and today's date (update the date each time you modify the document).
1. Watch the **[lesson videos][lesson]** to understand the scope of the project and how to proceed.    
1. After watching the videos, start filling out the PDD.

    At this point you may not have a complete concept for the game, focus on the first two sections and ideas for:
        - Your player & their goal
        - The opponents they face
        - Their powers

    Note that each segment of the design document corresponds to a unit. At this point your ideas may be "full of holes" - that's ok. Just do the best that you can and know that as you progress through the course you'll be broadening your sense of possibilities and will be able to refine your PDD.
    
1. Submit a link to the PDD.
